Implemented graceful close
- client sends a FIN segment when it has sent all its data
- server responds with an ACK if it has received all the data up to this segment
- server then sends its own FIN segment
- client responds with an ACK and closes the connection
- server then closes connection

Test Cases
- GBN no loss
- SR no loss

Graceful close doesn't work properly if loss rate is > 0
- If an ACK for a FIN segment from the client side gets lost, the client closes regardless and the server perpetually resends the FIN.
- This causes the server to endlessly resend the FIN segment
